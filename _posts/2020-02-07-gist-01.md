### 1. Add script file. 

Add gist embedding script into your github pages. 

```raw
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Albert-W/e37d1c4fa30c430c37d7b1b1fe9b60d8.js"></script>
```

### 2. For asynchronously-loaded page

The embedding script will execute *document.write* function. If you are using asynchronously-loaded one error will occur. 
（出于浏览器的安全机制，浏览器是会禁止异步加载过来的js执行document写入操作的。）

```error
 Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document': It isn't possible to write into a document from an asynchronously-loaded external script unless it is explicitly opened.
```
In order to solve this problem, Iframe is required. A demo is giving as follow. 

<iframe 
    width="100%"
    onload="this.style.height=(this.scrollHeight+200)+'px';"      
    scrolling="auto"  
    src="data:text/html;charset=utf-8,
    <head><base target='_blank' /></head>
    <body><script src='https://gist.github.com/Albert-W/e37d1c4fa30c430c37d7b1b1fe9b60d8.js'></script>
    </body>">
